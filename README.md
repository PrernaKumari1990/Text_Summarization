# Text_Summarization
Text Summarization is the creation of short, accurate summaries from longer document. Here I have used a NLP model named "Pegasus" because it is a pretrained model on large corpus of diverse text data and then fine tuned for specific summarization tasks. It is a abstractive text summarization, means it can generate a concise summary of given document
